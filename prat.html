    <p>A "rare" 650-year-old coin has been found in a secret drawer in a desk left to a woman by a long-lost relative.<p>
        The 14th Century coin was discovered inside one of three hidden drawers in a 20th Century bureau.<p>
        Amy Clapp, from Derbyshire, inherited the piece of furniture from a great cousin and had taken it to be valued.<p>

        Don Collins, of Hansons Auctioneers, said the 22-carat coin was "very unusual" and he had "never seen one exactly like it" in more than 50 years.<p>
        Experts believe the Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied, dating back to 1365, could fetch double the guide price of £1,200 to £1,800 when it is auctioned in March.</p>
